# Harkness

Harkness is an early native AI-harness scaffold. Its Rust core maintains a local
project catalog and can safely clone GitHub repositories through the system Git
executable, preserving the user's existing SSH and HTTPS credential setup. Its
core also provides cancellable branch listing and locked, typed create,
checkout, rename, delete, and upstream-management operations. The same locked
service stages explicit paths, stages a whole working tree, unstages safely
before or after the first commit, and creates guarded commits and amendments.
The KDE Kirigami application opens on a project launcher — Recents, local
folder import, and validated GitHub cloning with progress and cancellation —
and opens each project into a shell showing its Git identity next to a lazy,
read-only file tree that never descends into `.git` or through directory
symlinks. A worker-backed branch picker switches existing local branches
without blocking the UI and identifies branches held by another worktree before
selection.
Managed clones are deleted only after a confirmation naming the checkout;
local projects are simply forgotten, leaving their files untouched. Git
repositories can create, list, reconcile, and remove first-class linked
workspaces on new branches, existing branches, or detached commits.

Harkness requires Git 2.36 or newer. Worktree discovery uses the unambiguous
NUL-delimited `git worktree list --porcelain -z` format introduced in that
release.

## Fedora development setup

On Fedora 44, install Rust and the Qt 6 / KDE Frameworks 6 development tools:

```sh
sudo dnf install cargo rust gcc-c++ cmake extra-cmake-modules \
    qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtdeclarative-devel qt6-qttools-devel \
    kf6-kirigami-devel qqc2-desktop-style
```

The GUI build needs Qt's `qmake` on `PATH`. If more than one Qt installation is
present, set `QMAKE` to the Qt 6 executable before running Cargo.

## Develop with Cargo

```sh
cargo run -p harkness-cli
cargo run -p harkness-gui
cargo test --workspace
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
```

With no arguments the CLI prints exactly `Hello World`. Its worktree commands
provide a scriptable version of the GUI workflow:

```sh
harkness project list
harkness worktree list <parent-id>
harkness worktree create <parent-id> --new <branch> [--start <revision>]
harkness worktree create <parent-id> --existing <branch>
harkness worktree create <parent-id> --detached <revision>
harkness worktree remove <worktree-id> [--force]
harkness worktree reconcile <parent-id>
```

Removing a worktree preserves its branch, allowing `--existing` to reuse it.
Ordinary removal refuses uncommitted files; `--force` explicitly discards
them. Reconciliation removes only missing Harkness-owned rows and their exact
Git administrative records. It never performs a repository-wide prune or
adopts or removes external worktrees.

The GUI opens a Kirigami window on the project launcher backed by the Rust
`HarknessBackend` and `FileTreeModel` QML objects. Its project shell exposes the
same creation modes, live linked-worktree inventory, selective reconciliation,
and a second confirmation before dirty files can be discarded.

## Install locally for Plasma

The thin CMake wrapper builds the locked Cargo workspace and installs both
executables and the desktop file. A user-local installation can be made with:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

After Plasma refreshes its application database, Harkness appears in the
Development category. Run `harkness-gui` directly to launch it without the menu.
